# Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

In this project, I developed a machine learning solution to predict housing prices across different US regions. Using a dataset of 5,000 property listings, I built a Linear Regression model that estimates home values based on key regional characteristics.

## Project Challenge
A real estate professional needed a reliable way to estimate property values for various US regions. They provided a comprehensive dataset, and I implemented a Linear Regression approach to create a predictive pricing tool.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 5,000 entries with these key features:
- **Avg. Area Income**: Household income levels in the area
- **Avg. Area House Age**: Typical age of homes in the community
- **Avg. Area Number of Rooms**: Average room count for local properties
- **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms**: Typical bedroom count in the area
- **Area Population**: Local population density
- **Price**: Actual sale price (target variable)
- **Address**: Property location details

## My Approach
I followed a complete machine learning workflow:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand feature relationships
- Prepared and cleaned the dataset for modeling
- Implemented and trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated model performance using multiple metrics
- Generated predictions with measurable accuracy
